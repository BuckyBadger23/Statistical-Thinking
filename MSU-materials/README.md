Montana State University contributions to CATALST
================

First we'd like to thank the authors of the CATALST curriculum for sharing their work so freely.  Their project is innovative and creative, and a great improvement on the typical stat intro which we have taught in the past.  

We  used the regular CATALST curriculum in Fall 2012, Spring and Summer 2013, and found that it did not exactly meet our needs.  The materials in this folder are  resources we have developed to provide a different version of the CATALST curriculum.  

In Fall 2013 we tested most of the materials in this folder, and are currently reusing them in 8 sections of size 35 students.  

Contents:
--------
1. MSU-coursePack-Sp2014.zip  
   This zipped folder contains the pdf file of our course pack and all the files needed to modify it.  We use LaTeX to build and organize the content, and others will need a version of LaTeX to make use of it.  The program is freely availabe, for instance as [TeXMaker](http://tug.org/texworks/) or [TeXWorks](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/).  If those seem too hard to learn, these files might also work with [LyX](http://www.lyx.org/) which looks more like a word processor, but we have not tested them with LyX.  
2. lessonPlans-Sp2014.zip  
  Pdf and LaTeX copies of lesson plans.  
3. homeworks-Sp2014.zip  
  We call these "Quizorks" in an attempt to get students to think about them in a different way than they have thought about past homeworks.  These are in MS Word .doc format so that students can modify them by inserting their answers. They then submit them  to their instructors online for grading and comment.

What's Different?
-----------------
 - First off, our intro stat class feeds right into a second course and into other courses around campus which require students to understand exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals.  We needed more material, especially on confidence intervals.  

 - Secondly, we chose to not use TinkerPlots.  Instead we've written some web applets which show animated spinners and "balls in a box" for random selection (These run on RStudio's shiny server).  We use a WISE applet to introduce bootstrapping,  and for testing and confidence intervals, we use the [StatKey](http://www.lock5stat.com/statkey) website created by Robin Lock and family for their book "Statistics: Unlocking the Power of Data". In personal communication, Robin has said that they do not restrict their website to users of their book, but they do much prefer people to use the website in conjunction with their book.  (We will soon be using that book with the other 13 sections of our intro stat course).   An advantage of StatKey is that students will be able to use it in the future on their own data.   

Unit Modifications
------------------
 - Unit 1 activities use  different scenarios.  Our students seemed confused by the first "iPod Shuffle" model elicitation activity.  
 - Unit 2 is also modified. We include an activity which shows how z-tests can be used instead of permutation tests.  We emphasize "scope of inference" as an important component of any report. If a study used a random sample from some population we can make inference back to that population, and if treatments were randomly applied then  causal inference is allowed.   
 - Unit 3 has been heavily re-written to introduce confidence intervals sooner and to show students several different ways to construct confidence intervals. We emphasize the connection between CI's and hypothesis tests and the long-run coverage interpretation of "confidence". 

Physical Space
--------------  
In the first semester, we ran CATALST sections in a regular classroom.  MSU has since remodeled two classrooms, changing the furniture to 7' diameter round tables seating nine students (3 groups of 3).  One computer at each table can project to a flat screen monitor on the wall.  This group activity approach works much better in the rooms with the tables.  Also, we are running these sections only in 75 minute class periods meeting twice per week instead of using three 50 minute periods, as we do with the majority of our section.  The group activities really need the longer times, and we still have trouble getting in a "wrapup" (necessary and important).  As recommended by [staff at U Minn](http://www.classroom.umn.edu/projects/ALCOverview.html), we have two teachers in the room to wander around checking that groups are getting the important concepts right.  It's too easy for all 3 members of a group to reinforce a wrong answer.   


We're happy to discuss these changes and other ways to improve intorductory statsitcs.  Contact: [Jim Robison-Cox](http://www.math.montana.edu/~jimrc/)
