Montana State University contributions to CATALST
================

First we'd like to thank the authors of the CATALST curriculum for sharing their work so freely.  Their project is innovative and creative, and a great improvement on the typical stat intro which we have taught in the past.  

We  used the regular CATALST curriculum in Fall 2012, Spring and Summer 2013, adn found that it did not exactly meet our needs.  The materials in this folder are  resources we have developed to provide a different version of the CATALST curriculum.  

In Fall 2013 we tested most of the materials in this folder, and are currently reusing them in 8 sections of size 35 students.  

Contents:
--------
1. MSU-coursePack-Sp2014.zip  
   This zipped folder contains the pdf file of our course pack and all the files needed to modify it.  We use LaTeX to build and organize the content, and others will need a version of LaTeX to make use of it.  The program is freely availabe, for instance as [TeXMaker](http://tug.org/texworks/) or [TeXWorks](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/).  If those seem too hard to learn, these files might also work with [LyX](http://www.lyx.org/) which looks more like a word processor, but we have not tested them with LyX.  
2. lessonPlans-Sp2014.zip  
  Pdf and LaTeX copies of lesson plans.  
3. homeworks-Sp2014.zip  
  We call these "Quizorks" in an attempt to get students to think about them in a different way than they have thought about past homeworks.  These are in MS Word .doc format so that students can modify them by inserting their answers. They then submit them  to their instructors online for grading and comment.

What's Different?
-----------------
 - First off, our intro stat class feeds right into a second course and into other courses around campus which require students to understand exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals.  We needed more material, especially on confidence intervals.  

 - Secondly, we chose to not use TinkerPlots.  Instead we've written some web applets which show animated spinners and "balls in a box" for random selection.  We use a WISE applet to introduce bootstrapping,  and we use the [StatKey](http://www.lock5stat.com/statkey) website created by Robin Lock and family for their book "Statistics: Unlocking the Power of Data". In personal communication, Robin has said that this is allowed, but they do much prefer people to use the website in conjunction with their book.  (We will soon be using that book with the other 13 sections of our intro stat course).  
  An advantage of StatKey is that students will be able to use it in the future on their own data.   
 - Unit 1 uses some different situations.  Our students seemed confused by the first "iPod Shuffle" model elicitation activity.  
 - Unit 2 is also modified slightly to ease some rough transitions. We include an activity which shows how z-tests can be used instead of randomization tests.  We emphasize "scope of inference" as an important viewpoint to tell if a study used a random sample from some population (making infernce back to that population) and if treatments were randomly applied (allowing for causal inference statements).   
 - Unit 3 has been heavily re-written to introduce confidence intervals sooner and to show students several different ways to think construct confidence intervals.
