Additions or edits are marked in __bold__ print.

Unit 01
-------

* p. 108, Question 1 now reads: Can you predict whether or not each of the 50 outcomes generated from the rat prediction
    strategy will match the random sequence of lights? __Explain.__
* p. 109,	Question 6 now reads: Copy and paste the plot __of the trial outcomes__ into your word-processing document.
* p. 110,	Question 9 now reads: Based on the plot of the results __from the rat prediction strategy__, 
    approximate the average number of correctly predicted lights (out of 50).

Unit 02
-------

* p. 134,	Sentence below the infographic now reads: The comparison between ~~data~~ __cat__ and dog people is primarily 
    conveyed via text.
* p. 156,	Question 5 now reads: How would you describe (quantify) the *overall* variation in these 25 
    cell phone bills? How far from the typical amount that you identified in Question ~~7~~ __4__ are *most* 
    of the students bills?
* p. 159, The 2nd sentence in the 3rd paragraph reads: __This is what is meant by a graphical summary of 
    the data; it is quite literally, a picture of the distribution.__
* p. 164, Question 11 now reads: How does the "typical amount of variation" you identified in 
    Question ~~8~~ __9__ compare to the ``typical amount of variation'' for the first distribution that you 
    identified in Question ~~3~~ __4__?
* p. 172: The blue box about "strength of evidence" (originally appearing on p. 186) 
    has been moved immediately after Question 9.
* p. 175, The 2nd and 3rd sentences of the text now read: To introduce you to the context of the data you will 
    be using, we would like you to read ~~the abstract for~~ __an article describing__ a study that was reported in 
    *Nature*. We would also like you to ~~watch a YouTube video~~ __read a web article__ that will help you further 
    understand ideas related to *p*-values.
* p. 175: The *What the p-value?* YouTube video has been replaced with a web article, [*Mission 
    Improbable: A Concise and Precise Definition of P-Value*](http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2009/10/30-01.html)
* p. 175, The first bullet-point now reads: Read the ~~abstract for the~~ article, *Visual Discrimination Learning Requires Sleep 
    after Training*. The ~~abstract and~~ article ~~are~~ __is__ available at http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v3/n12/pdf/nn1200_1237.pdf.
* p. 175, the second bullet-point now reads: ~~Watch the YouTube video *What the p-value?* 
    http://www.youtube.com/v/ax0tDcFkPic~~ __Read the web article *Mission Improbable: A Concise and Precise 
    Definition of P-Value* http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2009/10/30-01.html__
* p. 177, the research question now reads: Does the effect of sleep deprivation last, or can a person "make up" 
    for sleep deprivation by getting a full night's sleep in ~~'~~subsequent nights?



<!--

* p. 178	Make students enter data in-class. Make students graph the observed data in-class
* p. 187	Third bullet point is missing the group name “Sleep Deprived” before the mean is reported: “(M = 3.9 milliseconds),”
* p. 192	Airline HW – Question 2: Need to specify the three things they should talk about (shape, center, variation)
* p. 193	Question 8: tell the students to do a write up like was first shown in class for the sleep deprivation study instead of seeming to ask them to answer the research question based upon just their p-value. The way we have the question worded now, it is not clear that we are asking them to write up a report (which we may not be, let me know if we're not), but the suggested answer is certainly saying that this is what we expect.
* p. 200: On #7 it says “Ordinary shoe group average heightn:” Delete the extra n at the end.
* p. 214	Third and fourth bullets in the box on the margin: Right now, it's not clear that they are right-clicking on the "Dolphin Therapy - YES" percent and "Control -YES" percent.  It should be clear that they're clicking on the % in each group who improved, because this is the way we were having them calculate the observed results in pages 210-211.
* p. 220	Question 1 should be re-worded to say: “What is the treatment variable in this study? (Note: when you report what a variable is, you should always provide detail on what all of the possible outcomes for this variable are.)”
* p. 220	Question 3 should be re-worded to say: “Organize these data/results (i.e., frequencies) into a 2×2 table. Include a copy of this table in your assignment.”
* p. 221	Line 6, change the word proportion to boldface type: “each time collecting the difference between the proportion of…”
* p. 221	Question 9 should have the following statement added to the end (because we’re allocating more points to it in the rubric): “Explain how you obtained your p-value.”
* p. 221  Question 10 should be re-worded to say: “Answer the research question. Explain your reasoning based on your simulation results. Your answer should include the p-value and should be stated in the context of whether or not yawning is contagious.”
* p. 231: Bottom paragraph, second sentence, two typos: “In thoery [theory] this is required, but in practice, once a subject has been selected for a sample, she is usually no longer an eleigible [eligible] candidate to be re-sampled.”
* p. 230 	The third sentence has improved readability if replaced as:
Statistically, we wanted to determine the likelihood of the observed result (..stuff in parentheses…) given all the potential ways…
* p. 230, (end of 1st paragraph and start of second):	This text implies that random sampling and random assignment are  mutually exclusive: "the goal of studies that employ random sampling is also very different than the goal of studies that employ random assignment."  If a study employs both, then presumably it has the same goals as itself!
* p. 231, third sentence 	"A simple random sample (or SRS) is a sample in which at every selection from the population, all remaining subjects, or experimental results, in the population have the same probability of being included in the sample as the previous subjects or experimental results." I propose we cut this and just go with the definition in the next sentence, which is far easier to parse and I think sufficient.
* p. 242, first full pararagraph: "In 1988, results released to the public from the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse created the false perception that crack cocaine smoking was more common among blacks and Hispanics than among white Americans." Isn't this statement technically true, and thus not a "false perception"?  The false perception is that there is a link between ethnicity and crack cocaine smoking, which is different than the correct statement that it is more common among blacks and Hispanics.
* p. 244	Rephrase the research question so that it does not apply cause-and-effect:  "In the 1991 downsizing of the Westvaco corporation, were older employees significantly more likely to get laid off than younger employees?"
* p. 249, equation before #3:	 Equation has extra “* 100” in it, which should be removed to make the equation accurate.  ((58/137) * 100 = 42.3, not 0.423)
* p. 263 part (c) and p. 265 table:  Change “attribute to “variable”
* p. 270, Question 10:  change fist sentence to: “Just as with…this study made use of randomness in the design of the study.
* p. 271, 5th line: Change “contreversial” to “controversial”

Unit 03
-------

* p. 288, #7: Replace “passage below” with “Gettysburg address” because the address appears on the previous page
* p. 296	delete bullet: “Change the sample size from 10 to 25”. They already did this on p. 294.
* p. 308, Question 17	“Describe the population of students to which these sample
estimates (mean and standard deviation) apply?” should end with a period, not question mark.
* p. 315 question 6	Change “hand span lengths” to “percentages” and “Question 2” to “Question 3” (or just skip 6 entirely)
* p. 315, last paragraph, last sentence: 	“In another study the researchers might have found that 77 of the 124 couples, or 62%, of the couples leaned to the right when kissing.” Comma after 62% should be after “of the couples”, i.e. “...  124 couples, or 62% of the couples, leaned to the right …”
* p. 316, 3rd paragraph, first sentence	Comma should be removed; the sentence should be: “What you have is the observed data.”
* p. 319, 2nd-to-last paragraph, second sentence	Remove comma in phrase “sample statistic, and a margin of error”
* p. 327, 2nd sentence	Add comma after “on average”: “... tutoring program have, on average raised their school performance ...” should be “... tutoring program have, on average, raised their school performance ...”
* p. 330 instructions in margin	4th bullet: Delete extraneous ‘in’: “Copy and paste in the 19 memory scores for the JFKC group into the other mixer” should be “Copy and paste the 19 memory scores for the JFKC group into the other mixer”
5th bullet should say mean_JFKC_score instead of mean_JFK_score
last bullet: “the” is misplaced near end of sentence: “compute the difference between mean_JFK_score and the mean_JFKC_score attributes” should be “compute the difference between the mean_JFK_score and mean_JFKC_score attributes”
* p. 343 #17	Last line should say “See Question 6” instead of “See Question 5”
* p. 344	About half way down:  population is misspelled. 
* p.344	Question at the end of same paragraph as above should end with a question mark, not a period.
* p. 338	Question 2 should end with a question mark, not a period.
