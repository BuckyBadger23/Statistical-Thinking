<!--

* p. 178	Make students enter data in-class. Make students graph the observed data in-class

 "In 1988, results released to the public from the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse created the false perception that crack cocaine smoking was more common among blacks and Hispanics than among white Americans." Isn't this statement technically true, and thus not a "false perception"?  The false perception is that there is a link between ethnicity and crack cocaine smoking, which is different than the correct statement that it is more common among blacks and Hispanics.
* p. 244	Rephrase the research question so that it does not apply cause-and-effect:  "In the 1991 downsizing of the Westvaco corporation, were older employees significantly more likely to get laid off than younger employees?"
* p. 249, equation before #3:	 Equation has extra “* 100” in it, which should be removed to make the equation accurate.  ((58/137) * 100 = 42.3, not 0.423)
* p. 263 part (c) and p. 265 table:  Change “attribute to “variable”
* p. 270, Question 10:  change fist sentence to: “Just as with…this study made use of randomness in the design of the study.
* p. 271, 5th line: Change “contreversial” to “controversial”

Unit 03
-------

* p. 288, #7: Replace “passage below” with “Gettysburg address” because the address appears on the previous page
* p. 296	delete bullet: “Change the sample size from 10 to 25”. They already did this on p. 294.
* p. 308, Question 17	“Describe the population of students to which these sample
estimates (mean and standard deviation) apply?” should end with a period, not question mark.
* p. 315 question 6	Change “hand span lengths” to “percentages” and “Question 2” to “Question 3” (or just skip 6 entirely)
* p. 315, last paragraph, last sentence: 	“In another study the researchers might have found that 77 of the 124 couples, or 62%, of the couples leaned to the right when kissing.” Comma after 62% should be after “of the couples”, i.e. “...  124 couples, or 62% of the couples, leaned to the right …”
* p. 316, 3rd paragraph, first sentence	Comma should be removed; the sentence should be: “What you have is the observed data.”
* p. 319, 2nd-to-last paragraph, second sentence	Remove comma in phrase “sample statistic, and a margin of error”
* p. 327, 2nd sentence	Add comma after “on average”: “... tutoring program have, on average raised their school performance ...” should be “... tutoring program have, on average, raised their school performance ...”
* p. 330 instructions in margin	4th bullet: Delete extraneous ‘in’: “Copy and paste in the 19 memory scores for the JFKC group into the other mixer” should be “Copy and paste the 19 memory scores for the JFKC group into the other mixer”
5th bullet should say mean_JFKC_score instead of mean_JFK_score
last bullet: “the” is misplaced near end of sentence: “compute the difference between mean_JFK_score and the mean_JFKC_score attributes” should be “compute the difference between the mean_JFK_score and mean_JFKC_score attributes”
* p. 343 #17	Last line should say “See Question 6” instead of “See Question 5”
* p. 344	About half way down:  population is misspelled. 
* p.344	Question at the end of same paragraph as above should end with a question mark, not a period.
* p. 338	Question 2 should end with a question mark, not a period.
